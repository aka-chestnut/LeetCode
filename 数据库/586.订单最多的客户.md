# 我的解法

```mssql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select customer_number from 
(
    select customer_number,count(1) as cnt from orders group by customer_number
) tt
order by cnt desc
limit 1
```



# 其他解法

```mssql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select t.customer_number 
from (
    # 找出和最大订单值相等的客户值
    select customer_number,count(*) as res 
    from Orders 
    group by customer_number) t 
    where t.res = (
        # 找出最大的订单值
        select max(e.res) 
        from (
            select customer_number,count(*) as res 
            from Orders 
            group by customer_number) e)
```

- 同解唯一和非唯一问题，非唯一问题只需要在后面运用一个子查询再次嵌套找出最大即可
- 其实在groupby后不需要获得count(1)字段而直接加入条件可以省一层select
