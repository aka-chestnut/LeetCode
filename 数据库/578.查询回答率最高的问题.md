## 我的解答

```mssql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
select question_id as survey_log from
( 
    select *,row_number() over (order by ratio desc) as rn from
    (
        select question_id,
        sum(case when action='answer' then 1.0 else 0.0 end)/sum(case when action='show' then 1.0 else 0.0 end) as ratio
        from survey_log 
        group by question_id
    ) t1
) t2
where rn=1
```

## 他解

```mssql
select question_id as survey_log
from survey_log
group by question_id
having count(answer_id)/count(distinct q_num) =

(select max(rate)
from 
(select count(answer_id)/count(distinct q_num) as rate
from survey_log
group by question_id)t1
)
```

直接在group by...having中判断最大的，省去多一层select
